# RaspberryPiStreamDeckDronePlayer
Source code for an independent drone player using a Raspberry Pi, and an Elgato Stream Deck(and HiFiBerry DAC+ Pro XLR - optional)

The project was created as a way to not bring or use my laptop to play drones (underlying synth pads) when playing at House of Worship.
I run the script at boot with the Stream Deck connected. You can find the images and mp3 files i use in the Assets Folder.
